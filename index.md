      - title: Frontend Development
        content: >-
          I specialize in frontend development. I can deliver the HTML, CSS, and JS you need packaged within a modern web framework. I use Angular for most of my work but I can easily pick and learn the right tools for the job.
      - title: Backend Development
        content: >-
          While I specialize in frontend development I'm also very comfortable with backend development. My framework of choice is currently Express which I've used to write APIs, Slack bots, and Twitter bots.
      - title: Automated Testing
        content: >-
          I'm a big proponent of automated testing and the confidence it gives me while building and maintaining applications. I've written and self-published a [book](https://www.theangulartutorial.org/){:target="_blank"} on the subject. My tools of choice are Jasmine and Cypress.
      - title: UI Design
        content: >-
          I deliver user experiences that look great, are intuitive for customers to use, and will adapt to the variety of web enabled devices we all use today.

          If you are using Angular in a professional setting I can not recommend The Angular Tutorial highly enough.
