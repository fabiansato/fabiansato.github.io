Working with DirecTV and CNN, I was on a team of 3 developers tasked to create the “CNNgo” application on DirecTV’s set-top boxes for their 39 million subscribers.

Within the CNNgo application, I was solely responsible for building the user navigation, photo gallery, and all related content video streaming services.

Given the unconventional hardware for this project the application was required to run under 8MBs to meet DirecTV’s hardware limitations.
