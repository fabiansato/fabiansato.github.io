I was the sole developer building an internal video conferencing application to allow startup entrepreneurs to remotely pitch investors. Application features I built include live video streaming, screen sharing, real-time chat, along with Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox extensions.

I was also responsible for refactoring an entire AngularJS application towards a component-based architecture along with their internal CSS framework by isolating styles to components or pages, removing all unnecessary inline styles, and leveraging many other UI best practices.

Along with my development work, I also designed new features including an investment summary for limited partners, document management systems, and an entrepreneur portal.
