<p>You have a cool video. You decide it’s worth its own Instagram story.</p>

<p>You open the app, select the video, and realize it’s not suitable at all for IG stories.</p>

<p>Stories are portrait and your video was shot in landscape so it ends up looking like this. Far from ideal.</p>

<h2 id="story-templates">Story Templates</h2>

<p>If you’re smart and value your brand image, you want a nice template to wrap this video to give it a professional look. Thankfully, this isn’t too difficult.</p>

<p>First, we need to know the dimensions for an Instagram story. As of 2021, it’s 1080px (width) x 1920px (height).</p>

<p>Next, we need to know how much space to leave empty within this template for our video. After taking a few screenshots and taking another look in Photoshop, I came up with the following sections.</p>

<p><img src="/images/ig-template/template-sections.png" alt="Instagram story template sections" style="display: block; width: 50%; margin: 0 auto;" /></p>

<p>This should be straightforward enough. In the middle grey section is a 1080px (width) x 600px (height) section for our video. The top and bottom sections are both 1080px (width) x 660px (height) which is where you get to be creative.</p>

<p>Here’s what my finished template looks like with the middle section left as transparent for my videos.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-use-your-story-template">How to Use Your Story Template</h2>

<p>Now that your template is ready we can add it to our video.</p>

<p>First you’ll need to create an IG story and select your video. You should see something like this.</p>

<p><img src="/images/ig-template/step-1.png" alt="Add template to IG Story - Step 1" style="display: block; width: 50%; margin: 0 auto;" /></p>

<p>Next you’ll need to switch to your Photos app, click the share icon, and select “Copy Photo”.</p>

<p>Switch back to Instagram, tap the screen to open the text input, and click “Paste” to add your template.</p>

<p><img src="/images/ig-template/step-2.png" alt="Add template to IG Story - Step 2" style="display: block; width: 50%; margin: 0 auto;" /></p>

<p>Once the image has been pasted, you should see your template above your video.</p>

<p><img src="/images/ig-template/step-3.png" alt="Add template to IG Story - Step 3" style="display: block; width: 50%; margin: 0 auto;" /></p>

<p>Now you can simply touch the template image and pinch to scale it until your video fits nicely within the template.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
