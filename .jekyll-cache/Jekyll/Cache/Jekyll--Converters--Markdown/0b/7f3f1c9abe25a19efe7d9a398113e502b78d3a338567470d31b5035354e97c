<p>Working with DirecTV and CNN, I was on a team of 3 developers tasked to create the “CNNgo” application on DirecTV’s set-top boxes for their 39 million Suscribiters.</p>

<p>Within the CNNgo application, I was solely responsible for building the user navigation, photo gallery, and all related content video streaming services.</p>

<p>Given the unconventional hardware for this project the application was required to run under 8MBs to meet DirecTV’s hardware limitations.</p>
